    <h1>"Because you make me happy."</h1>
    <h2>What a stupid answer.</h2>
    <h2>The reason you love me is the same reason you love 'Mall Cop'?</h2>
    <h2>And how can that possibly be acceptable when you're collision in my world has done so much more than generate a feeling so fleeting.</h2> 
    <h2>So replaceable.</h2>
    <h2>When you have come here and changed ... my life.</h2>
    <h2>Well, maybe not, you know ... <strong>literally</strong> the life itself, but its trajectory. Its path.</h2>
    <h2>Because now</h2>
    <h2>I'm in a world I didn't know existed.</h2>
    <h2>And yes, maybe, <em>eventually</em>, I'd have found it ...</h2>
    <h2>Catching glimpses through the foggy windows of the path I was on --</h2>
    <h2>Lined with white coats,</h2>
    <h2 class="indent">And blood samples,</h2>
    <h2 class="indent">And my parents' dreams.</h2>
    <h2>But I've derailed.</h2>
    <h2>And I'm diving headfirst into loops and variables.</h2>
    <h2>Crashing into classes and objects.</h2>
    <h2>Swimming in pools of pixels.</h2>
    <h2>Where I am not "happy", but happier than I could have ever imagined being.</h2>
    <h2>Happy.</h2> 
    <h2>There's that stupid word again. </h2>
    <h2>So weightless.</h2>
    <h2>Dissatisfying.</h2>
    <h2>But then again...</h2>
    <h2>what more could you give me?</h2>
    <h2>What more could this collision possibly do but bring me to the happiest life I could have?</h2>
    <h2>What more could I have asked for?</h2>

    <h2>Hm...</h2>

    <h2>Maybe happy's not so stupid after all ... </h2>
